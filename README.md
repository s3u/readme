# My README

How I like to operate:
* Minimal opinions — I realize opinions are a burden we all carry, and I try to minimize mine. If you find me holding opinions, point them out.
* Structure — Structure lets us scale teamwork. Though I'm not a process freak, I prefer structured mechanisms to ad hoc activities (meetings, emails, slack messages, etc.) as much as possible.
* Optimize work for joy and not stress — Workplaces can be stressful. Most of the stress comes from poor interpersonal relations, assumptions, and how we process ambiguity. Hence I like to incorporate self-care and habits to reduce stress. 

What brings the best in me?
* Owning and driving things — Things move when each picks up their share and keeps making them better every day.
* Constructive dialog — I prefer dialogue to simplistic yes or no answers when dealing with complex decisions. I believe dialog lets us surface multiple options when no option seems possible.
* Continuous improvement — I believe we learn and grow when we stretch ourselves. Hence we must be willing to challenge each other and not settle for less.

What brings the worst in me?
* Victim mindset
* Not following through or throwing things over the fence
* Assuming, instead of asking

My blindspots:
* While I am processing, I tend to withdraw and be quiet. People may expect me to lean in, and I may not do that on the spot. Don't hesitate to nudge me when you see this.
* I'm generally not prescriptive. I like to ask questions to help you or the team find a solution. If you need an answer from me, ask so.
