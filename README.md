# My README

How I like to operate:

* **Minimize opinions:** I realize opinions are a burden we all carry, and I try to minimize mine. If you find me holding opinions based on my assumptions, point them out.
* **Mechanisms:** I believe in structure to scale teamwork. Though I'm not a process freak, I prefer structured means (periodic reviews, forums, and standups) to ad hoc activities (meetings, emails, slack messages, etc.) as much as possible. 
* **Optimize work for joy:** Workplaces can be stressful due to poor interpersonal relations, assumptions, and how we process ambiguity. Hence I like to incorporate self-care and habits to reduce stress.

What I prefer:

* **Ownerships:** Things move when each picks up their share and keeps making them better every day.
* **Constructive dialog:** I prefer dialogue instead of simplistic "yes," "no," or "can't do" answers when dealing with complex decisions. A dialog lets us discover mutual assumptions and surface multiple options when no option seems possible.
* **Continuous improvement:** We learn and grow when we stretch ourselves. Hence I insist on challenging each other and not settling for less.

What I don’t prefer:

* Victim mindset and learned helplessness — corp life gives plenty of opportunities to develop such tendencies. Fight those.
* Starting things and getting busy without a clear purpose and metrics to inform success. 
* Assuming, instead of asking.

My blindspots:

* While I am processing, I tend to withdraw and be quiet. People may expect me to lean in, and I may not do that on the spot. Don't hesitate to nudge me when you see this.
* I generally don't prescribe. I like to ask questions to help you or the team find a solution. If you need an answer from me, ask so.
